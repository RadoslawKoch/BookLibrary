BOOK-LIBRARY APPLICATION

There are two ways to build and run the application. Once is to used an IDE with maven build-in, the other is
to use System Command prompt with maven installed and configured on your system.

BUILD AND RUN TESTS:

All you need to see the test result and make the application ready to go is to use Maven command:

mvn install

Install target will compile our project and run all its tests.
------------------------------------
Expectation verification:

If you want to verify if all requirements are meet, please run only the MainIntegrationTest file.
To have all details please switch to Console view. Every requirement is tested and some of them is displayed

Entities:

There are 4 (simulated) entites in application:

- Book - correspond to a real book (a concrete book) that we can lent at library
- BookData - correspond to a book position/title (abstract book). Contains informations commun for many concrete books.
- Customer - Library registered customer
- BookOrder - alows to connect a concrete book with person and trace its history.

-------------------------------------------------
Repositories:

For simplicity reason and because of not using a real database, Repositories were made fake.
They are all sigeltons (insteed of beans for simplicity/Spring DI module couldn't be used).
Data is retrained on runtime in ConcurrencyHashMaps. The relationships between object are simulated at Service level
